                                                First, I looked at social media platforms for artists/designers. There were many for designers such as Dribbble, Behance, and Coroloft, yet there weren’t any platforms for visual and performance artists. More importantly, no platform served multiple art/design disciplines.

                                                I wanted to know how artists/designers use social media for their professional developments, what they like/dislike the most about the existing platforms, and their general professional experience.
                                                <br><br>
                                                From the 42 responses I received, most performers, artists, and designers expressed that they lack essential business and project management knowledge. It was especially true among artists/designers with 1-3 years of experience.

                                                <strong>Interviews</strong><br>
                                                I interviewed artists/designers with varying lengths of experience to discover how their careers had been, what they enjoyed the most, and what’s the biggest challenge they have experienced.
                                                <br><br>
                                                I found that many are dissatisfied with the creative industry’s business structure. Many artists and musicians need to go through gallery/agent/streaming platforms to profit from their works. And very often, they only receive a small portion of what their works are worth.
                                                <br><br>
                                                For some who worked in the freelance industry, their freelance workflows are deeply fragmented. They have to use many communication tools to communicating expectations, sharing updates, and managing client relationships.

Users can customize their profile pages to showcase their individualities and utilize the project management tool to navigate the freelance process.

                                        <p>We decided to focus on a couple of things</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Improved the aesthetic of the platform. Users found the prettier UI more usable, and investors/startup judges are drawn to fleshed out UI.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Abandoned variable tile-format and customizable profile page to ensure we provide a consistent experience across the platform
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Expand the potential features and tools that can empower artists and designers.

                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            We realized the <strong>customizable profile page could not truly replace the creator’s need for a personal page, no matter how extensive the customization is.</strong> We abandoned the profile customization feature and the variable-size til format and opted for a uniform card system to ensure a consistent experience throughout the platform.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Also, we decided to <strong>focus on how we can further empower the artists/designers and developed different tools/features</strong> that can help them market their works, reach out to clients, and understand the legal/business aspect of the freelance process.

                                                The team went on a short COVID hiatus to focus on a side project that helps independent artists during the pandemic. You can see the short case study here. We are currently assembling an in-house development team to move this platform out of the MVP stage.

                                                <strong>Know your audience.</strong><br>
                                                When I presented my design, I assumed that as long as the design is user-focused backed with research, I would be able to persuade my team or panels of judges. But I forgot to consider the audience of my presentation. I failed to see from their perspective and to consider building an engaging narrative or including important metrics to back my design.
                                                <br><br>
                                                <strong>Keep users in mind throughout different stages of design.</strong><br>
                                                Sometimes, the team came up with a seemingly innovative feature and got too excited to think if this is something the users would need. It would be much later that I remember to validate if this feature can benefit them. <br><br>
                                                <strong>Test early and often
                                                </strong><br>
                                                I wish we had more time to validate the solution early on. We understood the problem from the user research, but we didn’t know if our solution was the right one. We tested for usability, but we didn’t test to see if our solution is correct. <br><br>
