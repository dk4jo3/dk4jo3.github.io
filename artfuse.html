                                                As a UX/UI and creative strategy specialist at Artfuse. I conducted qualitative and quantitative design research to narrow down the target user group, validate hypotheses, and uncover design opportunities. I also developed mockups and interactive prototypes with Figma, Invision, and HTML/CSS for the platform.

                                                <strong>Constant pivot and design changes:</strong> Things moved extremely fast in Artfuse. I have learned not the be too attached to my design. And when the founder or investors suggest design changes, I tried to understand where they were coming from and offer different options to achieve the goal instead of just saying no.
                                                <br><br> <strong>Interacting with stakeholders:</strong> Sometimes, the stakeholder would propose outdated design practices or unfit design changes. I would sit down with them to understand why and show them my process and rationale, and show them what the best current design practices would be
                                                <br><br>
                                                <strong>Technical and design debt:</strong> For an early-stage startup, the limitation mainly lies in human and monetary capital. Often, team members would suggest new features to make the platform more attractive to the investors. I introduced them to the concept of MVP and how it’s good to have an array of different ideas, but we should keep the core value offering in mind to start small and test constantly.

                                                First, I looked at social media platforms for artists/designers. Many designers use Dribbble, Behance, and Coroloft, but no platforms are designated for visual and performance artists. More importantly, no platform served multiple art/design disciplines.

                                                <br><br>
                                                From the 42 responses I received, most performers, artists, and designers expressed that they lack essential business and project management knowledge. It was especially apparent among artists/designers with 1-3 years of experience.

                                                <strong>Interviews</strong><br>
                                                I interviewed artists/designers with varying amounts of experience to discover how their careers had been, what they enjoyed the most, and <strong>what’s the biggest challenge they have experienced.</strong>

                                                I found that many are dissatisfied with the creative industry’s business structure. Many artists and musicians need to go through gallery/agent/streaming platforms to profit from their work, and they would often only receive a small portion of what their work was worth.
                                                <br><br>
                                                For some who worked in the freelance industry, their freelance workflows were deeply fragmented. They have to use many communication tools to communicate expectations, share updates, and manage client relationships.

                                                The team went on a short COVID hiatus to focus on a side project that helps independent artists during the pandemic. You can see the short case study here. We are currently assembling an in-house development team to move this platform out of the MVP stage.

                                                When I presented my design, I assumed that as long as the design is user-focused backed with research, I would persuade my team or panels of judges. But I forgot to consider the audience of my presentation. As a result, I failed to see from their perspective and consider building an engaging narrative or including important metrics to back my design.
                                                <br><br>
                                                <strong>Keep users in mind throughout different stages of design.
                                                </strong><br>
                                                Sometimes, the team came up with a seemingly innovative feature and got too excited to think about something the users would need. It would be much later that I remember to validate if this feature can benefit them.
                                                <br><br>
                                                <strong>Validate product concept.

                                                </strong><br>
                                                I wish we had more time to validate the solution early on. We understood the problem from the user research, but we didn’t know if our solution was the right one. We tested for usability, but we didn’t test to see if our solution is correct.
