From analyzing existing social media platforms, it is evident that there are significant gaps between art, design, and performance art social media platforms. In the current creative industry, interdisciplinary collaboration is a huge part of it yet it is often overlooked by existing platforms.

Questions on a survey I fielded investigated participants’ behaviors and perception of art/design social media, as well as the way participants view their own work.                          <br><br> 
From the 44 samples gathered, the majority of them disagree that existing art/design social media platforms are helpful in professional development and connecting with other creative disciplines. The majority of them agree that they lack certain business and management skills that are essential in professional settings.

More than half of the responses stated besides having presences on social media platforms, they also have personal websites.

I interviewed a wide range of interviewees, from a professional photographer whose works have been exhibited in the MET and Getty Museum to a recently-graduated performance artist who currently resides in Los Angeles. Some similarities they share are the dissatisfaction over the lack of transparent monetary transaction in the current industry and the exhaustive yet empowering business-related process of selling their artworks, such as setting up exhibitions, networking with potential buyers, or actively searching for audition opportunities.

The process of starting a project in the project dashboard tool is streamlined so the user would not have to go back to the main page to do so.
                            <br><br>
To accommodate for users with vastly different needs, the main portal is implemented in order to lead them to the contents that are the most useful and interesting to them.
                          <br><br>
The flow of discovering different artists and designers from the profile page is improved so the users would have a direct path to discover artists instead of needing to go to back the front page to do so.
