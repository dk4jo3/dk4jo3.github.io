                                The work began as a narrow request: “Can we drop a SQL-builder UI into the
                                product?”However, discovery revealed a larger issue: hundreds of off-platform scripts
                                were causing silent data errors and consuming support resources. I reframed the effort
                                into a Centralized Business Check Repository that would surface, govern, and track every
                                check, transforming a tooling request into a self-serve data-quality initiative.

                                Cascade reviews with Engineering, QA, and Architecture kept patterns reusable and

                                The toughest audience was the PPS Leadership. Their initial pushback stemmed from two
                                core tensions:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Job security concerns: The self-serve shift was perceived as a potential threat to
                                    their roles
                                </li>
                                <li>Misalignment on feature priorities: they had a backlog of technical needs that
                                    didn’t always line up with the PM’s vision for client-facing tooling
                                </li>

                                As a result, feedback was slow and guarded, with some gatekeeping around access to
                                scripts and process logic.

                                I worked closely with the PM to reframe the feature as workload relief: highlighting

                                changed the tone. After two rounds of iteration, including integrating their tasks
                                around sequencing and library import, they signed on and even assigned a dedicated PPS
                                analyst to help us

                                With the PPS feedback, we surfaced a more complete feature set, but not everything could

                                Engineering to assess effort and trade-offs, we prioritized what to keep, what to defer,
                                and what would deliver the most impact with the least complexity.

                                The work began as a narrow request: “Can we drop a SQL-builder UI into the
                                product?”However, discovery revealed a larger issue: hundreds of off-platform
                                scripts
                                were causing silent data errors and consuming support resources. I reframed the
                                effort
                                into a Centralized Business Check Repository that would surface, govern, and
                                track every
                                check, transforming a tooling request into a self-serve data-quality initiative.

                                Low-fidelity flowcharts helped align teams early by exposing technical constraints and
                                clarifying workflows. Building early alliances with PMs, developers, and design peers
                                provided crucial support for navigating complex decisions.

                                teams like PPS, to avoid misalignment and ensure mutual understanding of priorities.
