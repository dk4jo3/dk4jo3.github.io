What is patient experience, and how can it be improved?
                          <br><br> 
Patient experience is a complex web of ecosystems with a multitude of stakeholders and interactions. But as I researched into the main topics around patient experience, a recurring keyword kept on appearing – clinical empathy. Better patient experience derives from the better relationships between patients and medical staff. And better relationships come from empathetic communications. Yet without clinical empathy, this would be entirely impossible to accomplish.

There have been vastly different definitions of the term “clinical empathy” throughout the history. More recently, researcher began to define practicing clinical empathy as possessing the ability to understand patient’s emotion then communicate the understanding back to the patients to subtly inform that they care and respect patient’s emotions.

I interviewed several medical professionals, and experts of clinical empathy training. Throughout our conversations, I enquired them about how they define clinical empathy, their opinions on the subject, as well as their hopes and regrets within their professional experience thus far.
                            <br><br>
One thing that stood out to me was the polarized opinions on the practice of clinical empathy. Dr. Back stated that time should not be an issue to properly practice clinical empathy since it is about asking the right questions and having the skills. While others stated they wished they could have spent more time with patients to establish a better and more empathetic relationship with them.

During my research, I have gotten ill twice with strep throat. I purposefully chose two different healthcare organizations to examine the success, and pain points of two different experience.
                          <br><br>
The experience at SU Health Center was much better than the one at Crouse Promptcare as the physician was more approachable and caring about my symptoms. The physician at SU Health Center chatted with me about topics other than my medical condition and gave me further medical instruction with friendly attitude while the physician at Crouse Promptcare only briefly discussed my symptoms with me then prescribed me antibiotics.
                          <br><br>
The layout of the clinic room also made a great difference. In SU Health Center, the computer was situated between me and the physician, allowing the physician make eye contact with me while the assistant asked me basic inquiry questions and entered them into the laptop. At Crouse Promptcare, the computer is located on the opposite corner of me, and the physician's back was facing me almost the entire time.

Beyond medical and nursing schools, there are only a handful of services that provide clinical empathy training.  
                            <br><br>
Vital Talk and Oncotalk both focused on physicians who treat patients with end-of-life illness, while Empathetics focuses on general medical staff and managements as well.
                          <br><br>
They also employed different forms of training. Vital Talk, and Oncotalk utilize in-person seminars, while Empathetics utilized application-based training and in-person consultation for hospital management.

The service map of current clinical empathy training programs outlines the interactions, and the exchange of information between their physicians, other medical staff, and patients. It is possible to improve the knowledge and techniques of practicing clinical empathy with the structure, yet there is no system implemented to ensure the practice of clinical empathy in the real medical environment.
                          <br><br>
It is doubtful that the training of clinical empathy can increase the frequency of practicing it in the actual clinical environment. Even though they claimed their programs have shown successful results to increase clinical empathy, other studies have pointed out the summative assessments were done shortly after the training in the controlled environment. There was no evidence suggesting the training would have a lasting effect in the actual clinical environment.

It has been proven that clinical empathy is an essential element in meaningful patient experience. However, it is not commonly practiced due to restraints such as like time, perception, and lack of training. 
                          <br><br>
Even though research has stated that clinical empathy can be trained, there is no evidence suggesting the long-lasting effect of them on the physicians. Current training system lacks ongoing engagement that can encourage, motivate, and remind physicians the importance of clinical empathy, and promote the practice of it.

My target users are the internists that see out-patients within large healthcare organizations.
                          <br><br>
Usually, it would be fairly challenging for them to establish strong interpersonal relationships with their patients since they engage with different out-patients every day. And their wide level of medical expertise engages with patients with varieties of different medical conditions. Working within large healthcare organizations, they are usually under pressure from upper management about their efficiency and outcomes.                           <br><br>
The selected target users group certainly made the project more challenging due to the circumstances, yet I believe they are the one who would benefit the most from the scope of this project.

With 3 physician archetypes and 3 patients ones, I created different possible journey, detailing their interaction, moods, and locations of their respective experience.

I then organized the data from the experience map and created behavioral maps based on the foot traffic, mood, and percentage of time spent within the clinic room to understand what are some potential intervention points that can be utilized to affect physicians’ daily workflow to remind and motivate them to practice clinical empathy.

The criterias of the touch-points include having a large influence in the patient's experience in the clinical space and being frequently engaged by physicians and/or patients.

I wanted to utilize the touch-points in a subtle, psychological, and un-disruptive way that would affect physicians’ workflows without being authoritative, telling them what to do. I then began to conceptualize how those touch-points can be modified to bring minor inconvenience in their workflows to bring individuality into every interaction with the patients.
                          <br><br>
In the beginning stage of brainstorming, I challenged myself to come up with crazy, seemingly impossible ideas, then build upon, modified, or attenuated them to be more suitable to the reality.

With the feedback I have received and the progress of building upon the ideas, I gradually shifted focus from using certain physical touchpoints to change one specific moment within patients’ experience in the clinical room.
                          <br><br>
The specific moment is when physicians first gain the impression of the patient. For this instance, it would be when physicians are reading patient’s EHR and when physicians first enter the room. Instead of standardized health records that simplify patients down to just numbers and descriptions, I want to transform health records to represent the individuality of each patient.                        </p>

I gave participants a scenario in which they were sitting on the bed in the clinical room and was handed an iPad with the application before seeing the physician. The majority of them were able to navigate through the interface smoothly, yet some showed confusion about the purpose of this application and the connection between the series of actions.
                          <br><br>
To successfully communicating the purpose of the application turned out to be the most challenging aspect of the prototyping stage. If users know the real purpose of the drawing can affect their willingness to create drawing to truly reflect their individuality. And lengthy explanation can also drive them away from using it. Yet without a reason, it would be difficult to convince them to draw.                          
                            <br><br>
After more testings and discussions, I came to the solution of creating separate narrative and purpose for the patients. For patients, this application is not to show their individuality but to show their support to a cause of their choice.

In reality, users can use the product in ways designers weren’t intended to. I considered different scenario of how user would use this application and how would the application respond to present individuality in their electronic health record. Scenarios from users not using the application at all to purposefully drawing inappropriate content on it were considered.
