My thesis journey can be simplified down to three basic part. Research – a explorative journey that determined the one essential element to excellent patient experience. Brainstorm – an empathetic journey of being in both patient’s and doctor’s shoes to discover effective intervention points within their experience. Prototype – an user-centered journey of validating hypothesis, and develop the details of the intervention.</h4>

                      <p class="text-left">The research journey began with the question: What is patient experience, and how can it be improved?<br><br> 

In reality, patient experience is a giant web of ecosystem with multitude of stakeholders and interactions. It is impossible to research and gain deep understanding of every elements of it. Without a specific focus, this research process would only scratch the surface of issues and fail to create deeply insightful end product. <br><br>

As I dig deeper into each topic, a similar theme began to emerge – clinical empathy. Better patient experience comes from better relationship between patients and medical staff. And better relationship comes from better communications. Yet without clinical empathy, this would be entirely impossible to accomplish.</p>

Throughout our conversations, I asked them about their own definition of clinical empathy, and their opinions on the topic, as well as their hopes and regrets within their professional experience thus far.<br><br>

One thing that stood out to me was their difference in opinions regard the practice of clinical empathy. Dr. Back stated that time should not be an issue to properly practice clinical empathy since it is about asking the right questions and having the skills to do so. While others have stated they hope they wish they have time to spend more time to know more about the patient to establish a better, and stronger relationship with them.<br><br>

Many have responded that one of the reason many medical staff failed to create interpersonal relationship with the patients is simply they do not want to. Either because they are in this industry for the benefits, or because they do not see the need to do so.

The experience at SU Health Center was clearly better than the one at Crouse Prompt Care as the physician was more approachable and caring. The physician at SU Health Center chatted with me about topics other than my medical condition, and suggest me steps to take for my condition with friendly attitude while the physician at Crouse Prompt Care only briefly discussed my symptoms and offered no further suggestions.<br><br>

The layout of the clinic room also made a great difference as the one in SU Health Center is designed to face me with periodically eye contact while the assistant ask me basic inquiry questions and entered them into the laptop. At Crouse Prompt Care, the computer is located on the opposite corner of me, and the assistant’s back was facing me the entire time.</p>

                      <p class="text-left">Beyond medical and nursing schools, there are only a handful of service providing clinical empathy training with very distinctly differently focus.<br><br>

Vital Talk and Oncotalk both focuses on doctors who see patients with end-of-life illness, while Empathetics focuses on general doctors and administrations as well.<br><br>

They also employ different formats of training. Vital Talk, and Oncotalk utilized in-person seminars, while Empathetics utilized application-based training, and in-person consultation for upper-managements.<br><br>

However, they all lack of the ability to actively remind, and motivate their users to practice clinical empathy within their daily work-flows. They only provide passive training that can provide the knowledge and techniques of clinical empathy without being able to ensure the existence of such practice in reality.</p>

Again, it is evident to see it is possible to improve the knowledge and techniques of practicing clinical empathy with the structure, yet there is no system implemented to ensure the practice of clinical empathy in the real-world clinical environment.<br><br>

It is doubtful that the training of clinical empathy can increase the rate of practicing it in the actual clinical environment. Even though they claimed it has shown successful results to increase clinical empathy, other studies pointed out the summative assessments were done shortly after the training in the controlled environment. There was no evidence suggesting the training would have lasting effect of increasing the practice of clinical empathy..</p>

The reason being they would usually have a challenging experience to establish a strong interpersonal relationship with their patients since they engage with different out-patients everyday. And their wide level of medical expertise attract patients with arrays of different medical conditions. Working within large healthcare organizations would put tremendous amount of pressure on them regarding efficiency and bureaucracy.<br><br>

The selection of such target users certainly made the project more challenging due to the reality of their circumstances, yet I believe they are the one who would benefit the most from the scope of this project.
